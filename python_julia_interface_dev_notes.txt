### pyjulia and juliacall

We may use pyjulia or juliacall or both. At the moment, it looks like pyjulia
is preferred.

However, we have installed juliacall.
We have installed juliacall in editable mode.
This can also be installed via pypi with pip, as usual.

### qiskit-terra

We need a development version of qiskit-terra. So we clone the repo into qiskit-terra in the
toplevel and cd into qiskit-terra and do "pip -e ."
