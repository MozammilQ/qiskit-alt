# This dockerfile creates an image based on an image in which qiskit_alt has been
# installed, but not run. Here, we import and initialize qiskit_alt.
# No Julia has been installed. So, during initialization,
# qiskit_alt must download and install Julia and Julia packages.
# Here we use pyjulia.
# An image is built with this command:
# docker build -t qiskit_alt_3  --rm=false -f Dockerfile3 .
