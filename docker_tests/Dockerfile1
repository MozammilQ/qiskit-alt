# This dockerfile creates an image based on the image qiskit_alt_base
# which is created by Dockerfile0
# Here we just do a development installation of qiskit_alt in an environment that
# has been prepared with all dependencies except those developed together with
# qiskit_alt. We do not import or run qiskit_alt.
#
# An image is built with this command:
# docker build -t qiskit_alt_base1  --rm=false -f Dockerfile1 .
